The C# language is intended to be a simple, modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language.
The language, and implementations thereof, should provide support for software engineering principles such as strong type checking,
array bounds checking, detection of attempts to use uninitialized variables, and automatic garbage collection. Software robustness,
durability, and programmer productivity are important.
